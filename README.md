## About

This repository contains a sentiment analysis pipeline for tweets on the X (formerly Twitter) platform.  
It uses the **Sentiment140** dataset containing **1.6M+ labeled tweets**.  

The project includes:

- A complete Jupyter notebook demonstrating preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.  
- Saved model/vectorizer files for quick prediction.  
- Optional script to classify custom tweets.

## Features

* End-to-end NLP pipeline: cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization  
* TF-IDF vectorization with optional n-grams  
* Machine-learning models such as Logistic Regression / SVM / Naive Bayes (based on your repo setup)  
* Confusion matrix & evaluation metrics  
* Predict sentiment for custom user-input text  
* Easy retraining and extension
